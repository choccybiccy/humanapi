# Activities

> Activities are specific types of physical activities that occur during a period of
> time with a start time and an end time. These activities are often captured
> automatically using applications that track motion throughout the day, such as Moves,
> or they are recorded from applications such as Runkeeper or MapMyRun. They can also
> be manually entered with applications like Fitbit.
